          <p>It's a probabilistic publish-subscribe system for social networks, the whitepaper was written in 2008 (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/iptps2008/final/70.pdf)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed for use with structured networks</li>
            <li>In our use case it was used with Kademlia Distributed Hash Table</li>
            <li>Neighbors subscribe to topics</li>
            <li>Messages are broadcast between neighbors in multiple hops based on bloom filters</li>
            <li>A publish message is sent to three closest neighbors and so on for six hops</li>

        <section>
          <h2 class="headline">We were using Quasar at Storj for uploads</h2>
          <p>We were using the publish subscribe system to broadcast contracts into the network and wait to receive storage offers based on the contract</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client asks a Bridge for "pointers" to store data via `PUT to /frames/:frame`</li>
            <li>Bridge first checks to see if there are any cached "pointers" already existing</li>
            <li>Bridge would queue work for network nodes to publish a new contract to the network</li>
            <li>Renter network nodes would then send a PUBLISH message using Quasar to all subscribers</li>
            <li>Renter network nodes would wait for a OFFER based on the PUBLISH message</li>
            <li>When an OFFER was received a "pointer" was sent back to the Client from the Bridge</li>
            <li>The data was uploaded to that "pointer" from Client directly to Farmer</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section data-transition="slide-out">
          <h2 class="headline">Why Quasar wasn't working for uploads</h2>
          <p>There were many times when it would work, however the behavior was highly unpredictable with large periods of time when uploads would not work at all or break completely during stress testing</p>
          <ul>
            <li>General latency and unpredictable delays when relaying messages</li>
            <li>Participants in network are mostly all Farmers</li>
            <li>Participants could unintentionally overload their systems that will cause bottlenecks</li>
            <li>Refused to relay the message as to give themselves competitive advantage</li>
            <li>The eclipse attack, Renters could be predictably "surrounded" and messages cutoff by an attacker</li>
            <li>Farmers that were "closer" will have the first opportunity to respond for competitive advantage</li>
            <li>Data is distributed to be closer to Farmers with a similar hash which is susceptible to Sybil attacks</li>

          <h2 class="headline">The solution to the problem</h2>
          <h1>Performance metrics need to be continuously evaluated and used to structure the network</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Data should be stored at more reliable parts of the network</li>
            <li>Before a node stores a larger amount of data it should first go through a few performance checks</li>
            <li>Messages should be sent directly from Renter to Farmer to avoid delays and Eclipse and Sybil attacks</li>
            <li>Selection attributes should not be self identified by Farmers but verified by Renters</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="headline">Measuring performance and reliability</h2>
          <p>After more than a year of contemplating more advanced ways to build performance metrics for Farmers we decided to try out building a simple reputation system based on points for behavior.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The lowest possible `reputation` is 0</li>
            <li>The highest possible `reputation` is 5000</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Rewards:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 point for successful RPC message response such as `ALLOC or `RETRIEVE`</li>
            <li>10 points for a successful shard transfer (this could be weighted on shard size)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Penalties:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>-1 point for failing to response to an RPC message</li>
            <li>-10 points for failing a shard transfer (this could be weighted on shard size)</li>
            <li>-1000 points for going offline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Under the current design, each Renter is responsible to create their own view of reputation, there currently isn't a system in place to create consensus on reputation.</p>

            <div style="padding-right:2em;">
              <p>A load balancing system to send data to more reliable sections of the network</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Creates two groups of Farmers called "active" and "benchmark"</li>
                <li>The majority of the network data is sent to the "active" group, as to constantly be moving data to more reliable and performant parts of the network</li>
                <li>Contracts and broadcast directly to Farmers in a large blast of 30 or more messages, any unused offers are cached in case there are issues with the actual data transfer</li>
                <li>Before new Farmers join the network they need to perform a "proof-of-work" challenge to help mitigate Sybil attacks</li>

            <div style="padding-right:2em;">
          <p>The deployment of SIP6 was successful but had a few challenges that needed to be resolved</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using a timestamp and LRU query introduced race conditions</li>
            <li>Using randomized selection achieved more even distribution than an LRU</li>
            <li>Broadcasting the many farmers at the same time introduced issues with distribution as it highly favored the fastest response</li>
            <li>Waiting for several responses and selecting a random one achieved more even distribution</li>
            <li>Thanks @littleskunk for finding many of these issues</li>
            <li>Indexes needed to be added for farmer database queries to perform well</li>
            <li>The reliability and scalability issues with uploads were largely solved with more than 10x the rate of contracts and shard uploaded</li>
            <li>Timeouts for uploads went away completely shortly after activation</li>
